Wireframe of Spectrum's Customer Relationship Management package.

## Description
##### Technologies: HTML, CSS, VanillaJS, jQuery, and Bootstrap. 

The site is a quick wireframe for Spectrum's CRM software. The site has a collapsible sidebar, table, filer function, add function, and delete function. The site is responsive to all viewports. I thought the initial design given by Spectrum was too bland, so I added color and reorganized some buttons.
