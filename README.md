Wireframe of Spectrum's Customer Relationship Management package.

## Description
##### Technologies: HTML, CSS, VanillaJS, jQuery, and Bootstrap. 

The site is a quick wireframe for Spectrum's CRM software. The site has a collapsible sidebar, table, filer function, add function, and delete function. The site is responsive to all viewports. I thought the initial design given by Spectrum was too bland, so I added color and reorganized some buttons.

## What I Improved

* Side Drawer is now collapsible
* Header has sandwich icon in mobile
* Table is on auto scroll which is helpful for mobile.
* Added color schemes to buttons for a better pop
* Added pseudo-classes with CSS on all buttons to make the page less stagnant
* Footer added
